***One of the most important things in a productivity workflow may be to limit the number of services that you use.*** Nowadays, the issue is not to find tools, but to stick to the ones that we are already using.

To store and read articles, I try to stick to [Pocket](getpocket.com). However, in some cases, it is impossible to save an article to Pocket.

Especially, when you find an interesting article on Facebook from iPhone that you would like to keep for later, you have two options:

* save it in Facebook;
* open it in Safari, then send it to Pocket, close the article in Safari and come back to Facebook.

Obviously, the first solution is the easiest in the short-term but as explained in the first lines, it can quickly become a problem to increase the number of platforms that you use.

The second solution helps you keeping everything in one place but is much slower.

With the [latest release](http://www.macstories.net/ios/workflow-1-3-brings-powerful-widget-sync-health-actions-and-more/) of the [Workflow](workflow.is) application and its new Today widget, it became clear that a better solution was possible.

[This](http://www.nonatomiclabs.com/files/Current%20article%20to%20Pocket.wflow) very simple workflow allows you to simplify the process of saving an article from Facebook to Pocket.

Therefore, you only have to copy the article URL and launch the workflow from the Notification Center.
