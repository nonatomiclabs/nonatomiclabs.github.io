Hi, I'm Jean ðŸ‘‹

I am a French software engineer, living in Germany. I work as an SDET for more than 5
years. Currently, I'm working for Dataiku, where I play with Python, AWS, Kubernetes and
other fun technologies! Outside from work, I love coding in Go.

In the previous years, I have worked a significant time at Dolby for the next generation
audio codec AC-4. This was a continuation of work I did at university with binaural
audio and HEVC compression.

You can find my most current CV on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cruypenynck/).
