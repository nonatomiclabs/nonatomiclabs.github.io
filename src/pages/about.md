I am a French software engineer, specializing in programming audio and video software. I currently work at Dolby as a software engineer in test for the next generation audio codec AC-4.

At university, I worked with binaural audio and HEVC compression. My main areas of interest are digital signal compression, digital signal processing, and programming in C/C++ and Python.
